Hi there! Welcome to AWS Cloud9!

To get started, create some files, play with the terminal,
or visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/cloud9/ for our documentation.

Happy coding!
# Soundable

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Hello welcome to fullstack frameworks with django this is the final project in my fullstack web development journey. I have learned and utilized many new skills and technologies in order to get to this point.
This project is basically application which allows the user to create a profile, and was intded so the user can upload original songs and instrumentals for sale through this plaform for free.
This application allows for the sharing and collaboration of artists writers and producers in a way that is mutally beneficial for all parties involved.
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
The 
This website is desgned to be user focused allowing the user to really take advantage of the website, by adding music. Thus enabling muscians a w ay of earning real income from their commercial creations.
I am excited to offer this as a service becasue there are only a few others out there. I belive what helps nsoundable stand apart from others is the ease of use. Also ther fact that we are not tied to a big company which 
would require us to charge for the service to our customers rather the platform is created for the community to continue being creative and find a way to make a living from their art.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users preview songs from vaiour creators for sale
- Feature 2 allows users to a make a browse and search for a particular song throughout various genres...
- Feature 3 allows users to update thier proficl and information 
- Feature 4 allows users to view lyrics and other important information related to the current song they are previewing
- Feature 5 allows users to have an acccount and upload their own songs

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Feature to pay with stripe
- upgraded user interface with eyecatching design
- Shorten preview to 1 minute in lenghth


## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- Django, 
- SQLite3,
- , JavaScript, 
- Jquery, 
- HTML, 
- python
- CSS, 
- heroku, 
- stripe.
- -sql workbench (used for crud operations)


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

The testing proces for this project was ongoing throughout making sure data was being saved,login and login functionalilty worked as expected, 
ensureing that songs were being shown on the most recently added section of the ohome page, and also added to my playlist also making sure that the user profile was updatable and 
information was being save d to the database.
<a href="{% files/Soundable.pdf%}">link</a>

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.


## Credits
I would like to credit numerous cites for inspiration in ux design as I could 
not have done this with inspiration and at times a little persperation. Cites 
used for application inspiration <a href="https://www.rocketsongs.com/">here.</a> 
I would also like to credit the stackoverflow community for any methods and 
code snippets used, it was a really awesome resource to roll up my sleeves and 
learn on the website.
